# Contributors Guide

Are you interested in helping out?
Have a few minutes to tackle an issue?
In this guide we will get you setup into contributing to our project!

## Setting up your development environment

We recommend using the [conda](https://conda.io/docs/) package manager for your environments.
Our recommended setup for contributing is:

1. Install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) on your system.
You may have to restart your prompt for the remaining steps to work.

2. Now, with a local clone, of your fork\* you can create a development environment with:

```shell
conda create --name MYENV python=3 --file requirements.txt --file requirements-dev.txt
```

3. The changes should be made via GitHub pull requests\* against ``main``.
