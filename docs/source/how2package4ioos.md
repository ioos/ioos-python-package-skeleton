# IOOS packaging guidelines

## Why not a cookie-cutter?

IOOS packages are developed by multiple partners and enforcing a
cookie-cutter would cause more harm than good.
That is why we prefer a set of guidelines where only the parts that are of interested to the user can be copied instead.

This document describes these guidelines and how to implement them in an existing project or a new one.

If you know enough about Python packaging just visit
[https://github.com/ioos/ioos-python-package-skeleton](https://github.com/ioos/ioos-python-package-skeleton) and copy the bits that are relevant to your project.

## Project structure

Almost all python packages are structure as following:

```
|-docs
| |-source
| | |-_static
| |-build
|-tests
|-ioos_pkg_skeleton
|-notebooks
|-README.md
|-LICENSE.txt
```


Sometimes the `tests` folder goes inside the actual module.
We recommend that only if shipping the tests is important, e.g compiled modules.
If your module is pure Python it is fine to leave them outside of the package.

Always start writing tests and document from day 1!
We also recommend to write notebooks with examples that can be build as part of the docs.

Note that you should always have a README in your projects.
Markdown is a good format because it renders automatically on GitHub and is support on PyPI.

While IOOS does not recommend any particular license we prefer projects with OSI approved license,
the most common one is BSD-3-Clause.


## PEP 517/518

[PEP 517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/) species a build-system that is
independent of the format for source trees (your code).
The idea is to allow for other tools to become Python builds systems,
like `flit` and `poetry`,
via a minimum interface installation with `pip`.
PEP 517 really shines when combined with [PEP 518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518),
which specifies a minimum build system requirements via the `pyproject.toml` file.

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=42", "wheel", "setuptools_scm[toml]>=3.4", "cython", "numpy"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
```

When this file is present `pip` knows that it should install everything on requires before building the packages,
and knows that it should be built with `setuptools`.

The main advantages of using these PEPs together are:

- standardized non-executable config file;
- non-executable setup.py (safer installs without crazy workarounds);
- support many backends with one spec:
  - poetry, setuptools, pipenv(?), flit, conda, etc;
  - all should support pip installs.
- ensure that setup dependencies will be available at build time.


[This blog post](https://chadsmith-software.medium.com/pep-517-and-518-in-plain-english-47208ca8b7a6) contains a nice summary of these PEPs.

For IOOS packages we recommend to keep a bare bones `setup.py`,
for backwards compatibility, and to move all the package metadata to a `setup.cfg`,
while keeping the `pyproject.toml` only for the build information.

## `setup.py`

Most `setup.py` files can now be simplified to just the version handling and build call:

```python
from setuptools import setup

setup(
    use_scm_version={
        "write_to": "ioos_pkg_skeleton/_version.py",
        "write_to_template": '__version__ = "{version}"',
        "tag_regex": r"^(?P<prefix>v)?(?P<version>[^\+]+)(?P<suffix>.*)?$",
    }
)

```

We recommend the use of `setuptools-scm`.
Just add `setuptools-scm` to your development/build dependencies and the lines above in your `setup.py` file.
The version will be automatically generated via tags and changes in your version control system.

PS: `setuptools-scm` can use a file or `pkg_resources` to get the version number.
We do not recommend `pkg_resources`because, depending on the number of packages installed,
that can lead to a significant overhead at import time.

## `setup.cfg`

While could use the `pyproject.toml` for most of your project configuration we recommend
to split that between the `setup.cfg` and `pyproject.toml` for readability.
The former will have the package metadata and tools configuration while the latter will specify the build system.

```cfg
[metadata]
name = ioos_pkg_skeleton
description = My Awesome module
author = AUTHOR NAME
author_email = AUTHOR@EMAIL.COM
url = https://github.com/ioos/ioos-python-package-skeleton
long_description = file: README.md
long_description_content_type = text/markdown
license = BSD-3-Clause
license_file = LICENSE.txt
classifiers =
    Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable
    Intended Audience :: Science/Research
    Operating System :: OS Independent
    License :: OSI Approved :: BSD License
    Programming Language :: Python
    Programming Language :: Python :: 3
    Programming Language :: Python :: 3.6
    Programming Language :: Python :: 3.7
    Programming Language :: Python :: 3.8
    Topic :: Scientific/Engineering

[options]
zip_safe = False
install_requires =
    numpy
    requests
python_requires = >=3.6
packages = find:

[sdist]
formats = gztar

[check-manifest]
ignore =
    *.yml
    *.yaml
    .coveragerc
    docs
    docs/*
    *.enc
    notebooks
    notebooks/*
    tests
    tests/*

[flake8]
max-line-length = 105
select = C,E,F,W,B,B950
ignore = E203, E501, W503
exclude = ioos_pkg_skeleton/_version.py
```

The metadata and options fields are almost the same information that used to go in the `setup.py`.
In addition to the metadata we can use this file to write the configuration for
`flake8`, `check-manifest` and other tools.
We strongly recommend adding a `check-manifest` test to avoid shipping broken tarballs.
See more on tarball checks in the #travis-yaml section.

Note: `flake8` can be handled exclusively via #pre-commit-hooks.

## `MANIFEST.in`

Most of the problems we find with published tarballs is the lack of a required file at build time.
That is we why recommend `check-manifest` to help you write your `MANIFEST.in` file.
Here is an example that covers most cases:


```
include *.txt
include LICENSE # Please consider the Windows users and use .txt
include README.md

recursive-include ioos_pkg_skeleton *.py
```

## Do we still need a `requirements.txt` file?

Sadly yes, PEP 517/518 do not allow for non-python dependencies in the spec.
Even though the first two are already in the `setup.cfg` we cannot specify `libnetcdf`
and `libgdal` without an external file.

In order to make the package both `pip` and `conda` friendly we recommend to add the
external dependencies as comments and write a parser to read them in your CI,
or just duplicated them in the install section of your testing CI.

For example,

```
numpy
requests
#conda: libnetcdf
#conda: libgdal
```

One should also have a `requirements-dev.txt` with all the dependencies that are used to
build the package, build documents, and perform tests. For example:

```
# code style/consistency
black
flake8
flake8-builtins
flake8-comprehensions
flake8-mutable
flake8-print
isort
pylint
pytest-flake8
# checks and tests
check-manifest
pytest
pytest-cov
pytest-xdist
pre-commit
# documentation
doctr
nbsphinx
sphinx
# build
setuptools_scm
twine
wheel
```

## Continuous Integration

The easiest one to configure is GitHub Actions,

```yaml
name: Tests

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  run:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10", "3.11"]
        os: [windows-latest, ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]
      fail-fast: false

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0

    - name: Setup Micromamba ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: mamba-org/setup-micromamba@v1
      with:
        environment-name: TEST
        init-shell: bash
        create-args: >-
          python=${{ matrix.python-version }} pip
          --file requirements.txt
          --file requirements-dev.txt
          --channel conda-forge

    - name: Install package
      shell: bash -l {0}
      run: |
        python -m pip install -e . --no-deps --force-reinstall

    - name: Tests
      shell: bash -l {0}
      run: |
        python -m pytest -n 2 -rxs --cov=ioos_pkg_skeleton tests
```

This configuration sets a test matrix with multiple python versions and OSes.
The conda environment for the tests is created using the same requirement files as one would of with `pip` and the install section performs a simple `pip` installation to ensure everything works as expected on a user machine.

The test section will run all the items in the matrix if the conditions are met.
Note that the documentation section will also build for latest version, development, and the tagged version.

PS: one can create a local development environment using the same commands as the CI.
If you already have conda installed something like,

```
conda create --name TEST python=3 --file requirements.txt --file requirements-dev.txt
```


## Configuring `pre-commit` locally

With `pre-commit` we can run multiple checks every time we issue a new commit.
These checks can also be run on https://pre-commit.ci/.
This is useful when the contributors do not have `pre-commit` installed on their machine.

The configuration below can be dropped in the project root.
The checks selection are not comprehensive and not all of them are good for all the projects.
We will leave as an exercise to the reader to determine which ones are best for your project.

We do recommend `black` and `isort` for big projects with multiple contributors though because them help PR reviews by removing the code style from the equation.


```yaml
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
  rev: v3.1.0
  hooks:
    - id: trailing-whitespace
      exclude: tests/data
    - id: check-ast
    - id: debug-statements
    - id: end-of-file-fixer
    - id: check-docstring-first
    - id: check-added-large-files
    - id: requirements-txt-fixer
    - id: file-contents-sorter
      files: requirements-dev.txt

- repo: https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8
  rev: 3.7.9
  hooks:
    - id: flake8
      exclude: docs/source/conf.py
      args: [--max-line-length=105, --ignore=E203,E501,W503, --select=select=C,E,F,W,B,B950]

- repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-isort
  rev: v4.3.21
  hooks:
  - id: isort
    additional_dependencies: [toml]
    args: [--project=ioos_pkg_skeleton, --multi-line=3, --lines-after-imports=2, --lines-between-types=1, --trailing-comma, --force-grid-wrap=0, --use-parentheses, --line-width=88]

- repo: https://github.com/asottile/seed-isort-config
  rev: v2.1.1
  hooks:
    - id: seed-isort-config

- repo: https://github.com/psf/black
  rev: stable
  hooks:
  - id: black
    language_version: python3

- repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy
  rev: v0.770
  hooks:
  - id: mypy
    exclude: docs/source/conf.py
    args: [--ignore-missing-imports]

```

In order to run them in every commit one must install them with:

```
pre-commit install
```

Two other handy commands are running to all files (if you are configuring it for an existing project):

```
pre-commit run --all-files
```

and ignoring it in a commit if you don't want it to run:

```
git commit ioos_pkg_skeleton/some-dot-pwhy.py --no-verify
```

## PyPI auto publishing with GitHub Actions

For the `PYPI_PASSWORD` you can get the TOKEN from the PyPI website and add to GitHub's secrets.
The rest of this GiTHub is mostly a boilerplate package building and installation testing.

```yaml
name: Publish to PyPI

  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  release:
    types: [published]

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v3
      with:
        python-version: "3.x"

    - name: Get tags
      run: git fetch --depth=1 origin +refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*
      shell: bash

    - name: Install build tools

      run: python -m build --sdist --wheel . --outdir dist

    - name: CheckFiles
      run: |
        ls dist
      shell: bash

    - name: Test wheels
      run: |
        cd dist && python -m pip install ioos_pkg_skeleton*.whl
        python -m twine check *
      shell: bash

    - name: Publish a Python distribution to PyPI
      if: success() && github.event_name == 'release'

## gh-pages documentation auto publishing with GitHub Actions

```yaml
